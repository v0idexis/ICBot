## CONTRIBUTION
If you run into any issues while using the bot or if you want to request any changes or new features, open a new issue to let us know.

If you would like to contribute to the development and profitability of the bot, simply open a PR or let us know.

There are some open issues that set a general direction for development once the current implementation of the bot works reliably in Live mode (modularize, separate backend, create GUI, communicate with GUI through API).
